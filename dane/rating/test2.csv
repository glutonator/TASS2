"aalborg-airport","/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport","Aalborg Airport customer review","Klaus Malling","Denmark","2014-02-11","A small very effective airport with few flights. Check-in is notorious quick and staff friendly arrival very quick and busses to Aalborg frequent. Usually no problems getting taxis as well. There used to be a cafeteria but nowadays just a kiosk - but good cafeteria with reasonable prizes inside terminal. Security check quick and friendly as well. There is a nice viewing pavilion at one end of the airport. Outside note the famous ""kiss and goodbye signs"". Restrooms outside terminal however few.","","","","9.0","5.0","5.0","","","","4.0","","","1"

The Airport has got free Wifi and a small restaurant with shop on the land side. Airside you will find a small shop with pre-packed sandwiches and hot dogs and other small stuff a small duty free shop is also around but not very cheap. There is no Lounge to be found at the moment but after the expansion is completed there will be one available (around May 2013). Check-in procedures are fast and the waiting area after check-in is fine with a view on the tarmac. All in all a nice modern but small airport with expensive restaurants and shop.","","","","9.0","5.0","4.0","","","","4.0","","","1"

Free WIFI and free parking. Everything within walking distance. Most people travel domestic to Copenhagen but a rising number of international routes e.g. AAL-AMS makes for a lot of possibilities. Check-in is very quick and so is Security. All in all a nice experience.","","","","9.0","5.0","5.0","","","","4.0","","","1"
"aalborg-airport","/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport","Aalborg Airport customer review","Paul Van Alsten","France","2011-05-22","AMS-AAL and quite satisfied with this regional airport. Only a few flights per day so baggage reclaim understandably very quick. Bus line 2 connects with downtown Aalborg every 15 minutes weekdays but only hourly during the weekend - travel time is 15 mins and costs 18DKK. Check-in efficient and hassle-free using self-service kiosks. Free Internet computers are available landside - a nice touch. Security staff very friendly. Boarding area is rather cramped with limited seating - do not go airside too early.","","","","5.0","5.0","5.0","","","","3.0","","","0"
"aalborg-airport","/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport","Aalborg Airport customer review","K Fischer","","2010-08-04","Very quick check-inn and security screening. Nice and airy. Free parking! No need to show up at the airport very early as is the case in CPH. Only drawback is that after security you will be standing and waiting for the gate to open. There is is very little space here and no where to sit down.","","","","4.0","","","","","","","","","0"
"aalborg-airport","/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport","Aalborg Airport customer review","M Larsen","","2009-03-26","Aalborg Lufthavn (AAL) is a smallish airport near the city of Aalborg. There is not usually a lot of people leaving or arriving at any one time so there is hardly ever any time wasted standing in line for check-in or security checks - brilliant! A very friendly and inviting atmosphere overall.","","","","5.0","","","","","","","","","0"

"aalborg-airport","/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport","Aalborg Airport customer review","P Panagopoulos","","2008-06-10","It's a depressing airport in a depressing town! SAS and Maersk are the only operators using it besides a few private owners and charter airlines. Use it only if you have to! If there's no taxi waiting outside it is difficult to go to the city centre. The only reason this airport exists is to serve passengers who fly abroad especially via CPH.","","","","1.0","","","","","","","","","0"

"aalborg-airport","/airport-reviews/aalborg-airport","Aalborg Airport customer review","Kent C Cooper","","2004-02-17","I've been travelling through this airport every week for more than two years. Very easy access (12 min. from downtown Aalborg) right up to main entrance. SAS is really the only game in town once you get in and be prepared for delays on flights to/from Copenhagen (a 35-min. flight). Extremely clean as is the Danish way. Ground staff and crews are helpful enough but to any seasoned traveller this is a backwater airport. Again the SAS AAL-CPH-AAL leg is notorious for delays each week so if you have connecting flights out of CPH plan accordingly. Also upon arrival at AAL there are not always enough taxis waiting outside and you might have to wait a few minutes. Buses run into town on a regular basis but everthing at this small airport - taxis buses kiosk opening hours etc. - are all timed to coincide with arrivals and departures of flights from CPH.","","","","","","","","","","","","","0"
"aberdeen-airport","/airport-reviews/aberdeen-airport","Aberdeen Airport customer review","Kevin Yates","","2004-10-05","I fly in and out of Aberdeen Dyce airport a lot and have seen a marked improvement over recent weeks. Larger toilet facilities at arrivals (where their was only 1 for men and 1 for women). KLM has vastly improved it's check in facilities with usually 4-5 servis air staff in attendance. Departure lounge 1 has been improved with more seating. It could how ever improve it's lost luggage office (a real mess) which you will need to visit if you fly KLM often. Security entrance to departure lounge has changed as well with two baggage scanners (1 only ever in use though) and one personal scanner which is the bottle neck and leads to delays. All in all though Aberdeen airport is fine.","","","","","","","","","","","","","0"

"abidjan-airport","/airport-reviews/abidjan-airport","Abidjan Airport customer review","Pedro Gil","","2006-12-20","I frequently travel through this airport and would note a couple of problems in an otherwise nice facility. First I've arrived on another airline and been unable to get help in the transit lounge from Air I'voire even though they are my next flight. You have to get somebody to take you to the front desk through a little back hallway and tip them. Second if you go through the passport desk they have plain clothed policemen without badges who demand your passport in the luggage area without identifying themselves. The restaurant in the departure area is much nicer than the one outside the ticket area where you check in.","","","","","","","","","","","","","0"
"abidjan-airport","/airport-reviews/abidjan-airport","Abidjan Airport customer review","Grant Macpherson","","2005-05-28","I've been through ABJ Airport a number of times over the last couple of years and consider it the best airport in West / Central Africa possible one of the newest. Very clean and friendly with good security. Customs and Immigration take a while to get through but post 9/11 it's no worse than in the States or Europe. Air france the main carrier to/from Europe has additional security prior to boarding the plane. Check in staff and airport Staff both landside and airside very helpfull generally very good Duty Free taking both CFA Euro Dollars and credit cards","","","","","","","","","","","","","0"
"abidjan-airport","/airport-reviews/abidjan-airport","Abidjan Airport customer review","M Meiners","","2005-05-14","I had to visit Abidjan this January. There is no doubt the airport is more than a pleasant surprise: One would expect the worst for any West African ariport in general and even more for this one keeping in mind that the country is fairly isolated and suffering from heavy civil unrest and at the edge of civil war keeping most western travellers and business away. In fact the airport corresponds totally to European counterparts of the same size (fairly small thus). The terminal building is very new and has been totally rebuild in a quite recent past with all confort one can expect: Aircondition normal sanitary facilities and yes all is clean and in good working condition! On arrival jet aircrafts just dock at a direct tunnel connection to the building distances are quite short. All controls are very smooth with absolutely no bribes to give to any official. While standing in line for passport control a ""doctor"" passes trough the lines and checks vaccinations (Yellow fever is compulsory) every where there is security passport control is smooth and efficient although every one tries to be closest to the luggage belt this also goes quite smoothly including inspection of luggage. No unauthorized people in the arrival area and nowhere unpleasant people insisting on ""helping"" you carrying your luggage and then trying to run away with it (apparently some people do have a sort of authorization to enter customs area for helping passengers but not insisting). Departure also is quite smooth: Check in is done in an enclosed area with identity check at the entrance so here also one is safe after checking in there is just a short way up the stairs passing customs and then to the departure hall. Here also with all normal facilities: duty free shop large restaurant area some smaller shops and sanitary facilities still clean and in good working order! Altogether thus a pleasant experience!","","","","","","","","","","","","","0"
"abu-dhabi-airport","/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport","Abu Dhabi Airport customer review","James Anderson","Saudi Arabia","2015-07-19","I flew from Bahrain to Phuket and back via Abu Dhabi. Coming in, the airport is overcrowded and the extra security checkpoint for transit passengers grinds traffic to a halt. Shopping is plentiful. Unfortunately, bathrooms all had queues out the door and dining options are all located in one small area upstairs, very far from the gates. After boarding, we spent an hour on the tarmac waiting for ground crews to load bags. On the return leg, we were piled into buses then driven out and parked in front of three different aircraft for 30 min while the driver tried to find the right plane. When we boarded, we again spent an hour waiting while ground crews shuffled bags around. After arriving in Bahrain it turned out that only 7 bags had been loaded for the entire flight. We spent another 90 min in line while staff in Bahrain tried to clean up the mess and report all the missing baggage. As of yet our luggage has not turned up. I will never fly through Abu Dhabi again.","Transit","19-07-2015","Couple Leisure","2.0","1.0","3.0","1.0","","2.0","5.0","4.0","","0"
"abu-dhabi-airport","/airport-reviews/abu-dhabi-airport","Abu Dhabi Airport customer review","Jay Sitlani","United States","2015-07-14","Transiting through AUH is an ordeal, and lets down the very good inflight product of its dominant hub carrier Etihad. Herding transit passengers through a security line (and forcing premium pax into their own dedicated but much slower line) and requiring them to take their belts, shoes, watches, phones, plus anything else in their pockets off is absurd. And if you're connecting to the US, then you have to repeat this farcical performance. A new terminal is being constructed, and while I suspect it will be posh and modern and beautiful, it will still be burdened by these transit procedures. Etihad is a fabulous carrier, but the transit at AUH will make me think twice before I choose it for my long haul travel needs.","Transit","14-06-2015","Solo Leisure","4.0","2.0","2.0","2.0","","0.0","","","","0"
