Food on each leg (outbound mid-morning return early morning) was a simple processed cheese roll though for a two-hour flight the food is probably not the most important aspect of the journey. All-in-all a pretty reasonable experience with no major complaints.","","","","","","","","","","","","","0"

"adria-airways","/airline-reviews/adria-airways","Adria Airways customer review","Alex Stare","","2004-03-18","Flew march 12/14 on JP from ZRH-LJU-ZRH. The flights were on time the flight attendants nice and helpful. The sandwich has got an upgrade and is now equal to LH. A Minus point was that they were handing out only Apple Juices - if you wanted to have wine or other drinks you had to ask specifically for it. This gives me kind of a cheap impression as it seems to the passenger that they wanted to hide it from them. The wine they served was below industry standards and not what a wine country like Slovenia should serve its guests on their trip to the country. I absolutely agree that on such short legs there is no necessity of any food/drinks however either this is clearly defined in the service guide of the airline or then crews should adhere to their service guidelines.","","","","","","","","","","","","","0"

Overall I was quite impressed. All flights departed and arrived on time and the onboard service was efficient and reasonably friendly. Hot meals were served on all flights although the quality of these varied from disgusting to just OK. All drinks were complimentary. The aircraft (A320 and CRJ) were modern and spotlessly clean. Business Class seating is identical to economy with a moveable curtain. Transiting at Ljubljana was painless although it is a very small airport and the Business Class lounge is nothing special. I would happily fly with them again although they do need to improve the quality of their meals.","","","","","","","","","","","","","0"
"adria-airways","/airline-reviews/adria-airways","Adria Airways customer review","G Chew","","2002-12-06","I have just returned from a long weekend in Ljubljana flying on Adria from London Gatwick. The outbound flight was ok (food portions were a bit stingy given the 2 hour 20 minute flight time) and we arrived early into Ljubljana. Beware about arriving on a Saturday - the coach to the city centre are few and far between. I ended up taking a taxi which cost me 6500 SIT (about UKP 20) whereas the bus was 600 SIT (1.40). On the return flight Adria cancelled the flight for 'technical reasons'. Judging by the low number of people that went to the passenger service counter I think the reason for cancellation may have been more economic than technical. I was rerouted via Munich which added over an hour and a half to the journey and we flew into Heathrow (with BA) instead of Gatwick which left me with a useless train ticket and no way of getting home. The flight to Munich with Adria was good and an edible snack was served with apple juice. Despite the problems with the return journey Adria seems to be a reasonable airline and is an ok (if not the only) choice to get to this country.","","","","","","","","","","","","","0"

In both cases the plane was a brand new CRJ. Both flights were really smooth and the crews really efficient and helpful. Pilots kept us informed about everything during both flights. It was sunset and dusk and the flight over the alps was absolutely scenic. Despite the narrow cabin of the CRJ the pitch is quite generous and the leather seats comfortable. Both flights lasted 45 minutes and from MUC to LJU I travelled tourist class. Normally in short flights there isnt time for much than a drink. We receive an apple juice a cheese and salad sandwich plus coffee and tea. The LJU-MUC and due to an overbooking was on business. We were offered an orange juice prior to departure and then a tasty breakfast consisting in bacon and scramble eggs fruit salad a croissant and coffe and tea. Superb for such a short segment. Not being a prime choice its an airline which is pleasant to flight.","","","","","","","","","","","","","0"

The Zurich - Athens - Zurich legs were in Business class, to which I was upgraded for free being a Gold Member of their program Miles and Bonus. During the inbound flight I was served a 4 course menu, with 2 choices for the main course, with excellent wines, return flight was in the morning, so breakfast with 2 choices of eggs (scrambled and omelette), fresh fruit platter, greek yoghourt and bread. Responsible for the Business class section was every time the Maitre de cabine, who was very attentive and kind. Flights were on time (ish) and transfer in Athens was easy and smooth, even though inbound luggage could not be through-checked because of the lack of customs in Mykonos Airport (it was on return though). Only slight downside was check-in at Mykonos at 6 am, with only 2 counters open and queue moving very slowly, taking me 20 minutes to check-in my suitcase. But I guess that's more a matter of the airport than the airline.","A320 and Q400","Solo Leisure","Business Class","ZRH to JMK via ATH","10.0","5.0","5.0","5.0","","4.0","","5.0","1"

It all starts from the arrival in the airport where Aegean counters for Business travelers and gold miles card holders are filled with people which means at least 30’mins waiting for your check in. The return journey to Tirana is being carried out with a DE HAVILLAND 8-400 airplane with very little space for passenger seats. Aegean is allowing everyone to have more than one piece of hand luggage therefore you have to fight for an overhead space in this tiny airplane otherwise you will end up with the luggage under you tiny seat. Finally this journey costs only 260 euro (return) if you don't check in any luggage otherwise you have to add roughly 80 euro to the price.","","","Economy","","2.0","1.0","4.0","1.0","0.0","","","1.0","0"

I last traveled on Aer Lingus in 1977 as a child. The service was excellent and the food was great. So when I booked our trip in May 2015 to Italy through Dublin to Naples I was excited. I could not have been more disappointed. The service was terrible. There was only 1 flight attendant that gave a faint smile (and that was on all legs of the trip. A British staff member was on board for the final Dublin to Boston flight via Titan Airlines. They were a breath of fresh air and were very pleasant and actually smiled). The food was bad. The plane was pretty clean though. This was the cheapest airline I have flown on. They kept charging for everything. On the flight from Dublin to Naples they charged for every single thing even water. Not one thing was distributed for free. I could see if I paid very little for my flight but this was not a cheap rock bottom fare. Frankly I was ashamed of being Irish after I took the first leg of the trip. We were traveling with 10 other people and all agreed that they would have no interest in traveling to Ireland for a future vacation. So Aer Lingus - you might be saving a lot of money but you are obliterating anyone's desires to travel to Ireland in the future.","","","Economy","","2.0","3.0","1.0","1.0","1.0","","","2.0","0"
